# Hospital-Food-Delivery-System
This project is a full-stack web application designed to manage hospital food services efficiently. It allows the Hospital Food Manager to handle patient details, create and assign diet charts, and track meal preparation and delivery. The system also includes functionalities for Inner Pantry Staff to manage meal preparation and Delivery Personnel to complete meal deliveries to patient rooms.

Initial Setup
1. Frontend Framework
React.js (with TypeScript + SWC for better type safety and performance).
2. UI Framework
Tailwind CSS (for a modern, responsive, and utility-first design).
3. Tooling
Vite (for fast builds and optimized development experience).
Note:
Vite was chosen for its fast build performance and efficient development experience. Using TypeScript ensures type safety and maintainability in a project with complex functionality like role-based dashboards.
